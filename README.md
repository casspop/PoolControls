# PoolControls

Pool Controls uses a Raspberry Pi and an Elegoo 8-relay board to control a multi-speed pool pump and pool lights.

Pool Controls (not really a name, more a description) is a project that took form in a hurry. As is often the case in projects like that, the documentation has been sketchy and long in coming.

Finally, in the course of a re-build after lightning took out the Pi and the SD card, I actually carefully documented starting with a new Pi 3 Model B+ and bringing it online.

These instructions are what I need to rebuild it again, should the need arise.  I didn't go into details about the inner workings of Linux commands, so if you run into things that are unfamiliar, you will have to google it.

### A bit of History

The controls for your average backyard inground pool are pathetic.  I felt like I could do better with a Raspberry Pi, a relay board and some Python.  Here is what I have so far.
